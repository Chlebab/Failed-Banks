## Failed Banks
This repository contains an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) script designed to process and visualize data from the "Failed Banks Dataset" on Kaggle. The dataset includes comprehensive information on banks that have failed since October 1, 2000, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) often appointed as the receiver. This project leverages Python and Jupyter Notebooks to extract, transform, and load the data, facilitating the analysis of trends in bank closures over time, geographic patterns of bank stability, and the dynamics of the banking sector through acquisitions. It serves as a valuable resource for data science and analytics professionals aiming to gain insights into the financial landscape and the factors influencing bank failures.
